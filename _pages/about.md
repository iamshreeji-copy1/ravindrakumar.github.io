I am interested in creating algorithms that can model the structure, appearance and dynamics of the world around us from casually captured images and videos. To this end, I typically work in the intersection of learning based 3D representations, computer vision and graphics.

Prior to joining Cornell for my PhD, I graduated from the [MS in Robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) program at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I was advised by [Shubham Tulsiani](https://shubhtuls.github.io/). There, I had explored problems in the intersection of diffusion models and learning based 3D representations. Please checkout my [resume](assets/pdf/Bharath_Raj_Nagoor_Kani_Resume.pdf) for additional information about my research and work experience.

I am always excited to chat about research, especially about topics related to 3D computer vision and generative models. Please feel free to reach out!
